## Don't forget to apply the hotfixes!

Since I'm not perfect, and I have not a team of engineers to support my work;
some times I do forget some details when the image is ready and it's not worth
to re-build. Instead of just keeping the annoyances go along, I decided to
implement the "hotfixes" mechanics.

Here is how it works:
1. Flash the image as always.
2. Once your device boots, go immediately to the `Backup / Flash Firmware` in
  LuCI.
3. Upload the `hotfixes.tar.gz` in the `Restore` section, as if it's a backup.
4. That's all!

## A better feedback solution!

I've implemented the `ramoops` feature. If you find your device crashing or
becoming inestable, please:

1. Go to the settings in LuCI and enable the debug levels for the logs
  1.1. Verify that the size is `1536` and the file is `/dev/pmsg0`. Change it
      accordingly.
2. Wait the device to crash or to become inestable.
3. If the device crashes, go to the point 5.
4. If it doesn't crash, reboot as soon as you can. Try to not force reboot, if
  you can, by unplugging since it will clear the data from RAM and with it, the
  logs.
5. Check the `/sys/fs/pstore` folder, and if it's not empty, collect a copy of
  these files.
6. Along with the files from point 5, if any, collect a copy of the directory
  tree inside `/bootfs/pstore`, which are the collected logs over time.
7. Send these files to my e-mail. Don't expect an answer by email and instead
  open a GitHub issue. If you don't have a GitHub account, explain it in your
  email and I will open the issue and document the problem for you.
8. Over time, your boot partition may become full. Please cleanup your the logs
  from `/bootfs/pstore` if you are short in space. You can disable the
  automatic collection of logs by deleting `/etc/hotplug.d/ntp/00-pstore`, but
  `PSTORE` itself is a kernel feature that cannot be disabled, unless you build
  your own kernel. All logs will be removed automatically after a system
  upgrade.

## How to install

> Warning: the 'sysupgrade' procedure will reset some settings to their default
 values. You can see the changes made to your system by looking at the 'bootz'
 files in `/etc/bootz`.

First, decompress the downloaded file. This file is compressed using `zstd` and
it's a tarball.
 - If you are using **Windows**, you can install [PeaZip](https://www.peazip.org)
 - If you are using **macOS**, you can install [Keka (beta)](https://beta.keka.io)
 - If you are using **Linux**, you probably have all the tools already installed

You will find a folder once decompressed. Inside this folder, you will find the
following folders:
 - `bin`: this contains the two "flasheable" versions of the firmware. One is a
  `sysupgrade` image that you will use to update from another version or from
  OpenWrt; and the other is a `factory` image which you will use to flash
  directly from the Linksys firmware.
 - `info`: this folder contains the manifests, the configuration seed and the
  checksums. Also, it contains a copy of this document.
 - `patches`: it contains all the patches that apply cleanly over the fork
  point. Use them if you download the source code and want to build your own
  firmware form a working copy. Also, they need to be distributed due to the
  software licence.

### From the OpenWrt firmware or from another version of this firmware

Go to LuCI and apply the `sysupgrade` image. Either from the OpenWrt firmware or
from another version of this firmware. This firmware **will not** apply cleanly
over the stock OpenWrt firmware.

> **Note**: You should perform the upgrade without keeping/saving your settings,
 otherwise, your device will likely soft-brick. If it does brick, you will need
 to trigger a recovery as documented in the wiki. This happens because this
 build contains patches to make the switch work, but they will stop the device
 from running with the OpenWrt's default configuration and viceversa.

Go to http://192.168.xx.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/flash if you are using
another version of this firmware. Go to https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/flash
if you are using the OpenWrt firmware. Or you can use the command line if you
have not installed LuCI. Then, apply the update accordingly.

### From the Linksys EA6350v3/XX8300 firmware

From the OpenWrt [web page for the device](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/linksys_ea6350_v3):

- Attach to a LAN port on the router
- Connect to the Linksys Smart Wi-Fi Page (default 192.168.1.1) and login
- Select the "Connectivity" tab on the left
- Find the option for manual upgrade on the panel
- Select browse, and browse to the `factory` binary image
- Click update
- Read and accept the warning
- The router LED will start blinking. Wait for the device to boot up
- When the router LED goes in a slow blinking, you can now navigate to
  http://192.168.xx.1 to your new OpenWrt installation

### From the GL.iNet firmware

For the Convexa-B, you should follow the steps documented in the GL.iNet web
page. It involves booting into the recovery u-boot mode and upgrading the
firmware from there.

Note that for the Convexa-S, you will need to flash a "Factory to OpenWrt"
image first and then flash this firmware. Otherwise, your device will brick and
you will need to use a SPI programmer, contact the GL.iNet support team and
flash the NAND chip with the file they will make for you.

### Reverting back to OEM in one click (dual partition devices only)

> WARNING: this method only works if you installed the provided `factory` image
 directly from the Linksys firmware. If you have already "sysupgraded", this
 method will not work.

If you have not installed another update of this firmware or OpenWrt, you can go
to: http://192.168.xx.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/advanced_reboot

Then, you can click the "Reboot to alternative partition..." to revert back to
the OEM firmware. Wait for the device to reboot and load te Linksys firmware.

> If you have installed either OpenWrt or this firmware twice or more, refer to
 the OpenWrt forum for reverting back to stock (EA6350v3 only): [wiki](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/linksys_ea6350_v3)

## Features and packages

The binary installable image contains the following packages and features:
- `testcalibration` script for easily and safely testing calibration board files
 if your wireless performance is not optimal (EA6350v3 only).
- `BackToStock` script for easily and safely reverting back from the OpenWrt
 firmware to the Linksys stock firmware. Refer to the documentation in the
 wiki [here](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/linksys_ea6350_v3) (EA6350v3 only).
- extroot by default
  - using the OEM partition as `/overlay` for added storage to install packages
   and for extending the firmware ROM lifespan (EA6350v3/XX8300/Convexa-S only).
- DNS
  - Disabled `dnsmasq` DNS forwarder in favour of `unbound` resolver with TLS
  - Configured Unbound as a TLS forwarder for a secure DNS server (currently:
   Quad9)
  - Note that Quad9 already implements DNSSEC, you don't need to configure the
   router's slow CPU to do perform the validation again.
- Utilities
  - kernel features: taskstats (for atop/htop)
  - hardware: blkid, lsblk
  - tools: bash, nano, nologin, sudo
  - performance: haveged, schedutil, compressed-memory
- LuCI
  - uhttpd-openssl
  - apps
    - advanced-reboot, compressed-memory, uhttpd, unbound
- File Systems
  - exfat, ext4, f2fs, msdos (FAT16/32)
- Kernel features and modules
  - USB Support
  - USB Attached SCSI and USB Mass Storage
  - New Linux IOSCHEDs evelators and Governors
    - Governor: `schedutil` enabled by default for all CPU's
    - IOSCHED: `kyber` by default for non rotational disks
    - IOSCHED: `bfq` by default for rotational disks
    - IOSCHED: `noop` by default for single-queue devices
  - Fully preemptive @ 100 Hz kernel for more responsiveness
- Minimum CPU frequency set to 512 MHz instead of 48 MHz
- Enabled and unlocked all operation points to allow the CPU frequency scaling
 governor `schedutil` to take better decisions
- Changed clock latency from 256000ns to 100000ns (which is the value used by
 Qualcomm)
- Patched VLAN to work as expected for all supported IPQ40xx targets
- Patched SQUASHFS to avoid crashes due to spurious SPI errors

## General notes

All kernel modules for a particular version, among with a wide set of LuCI apps,
are automatically uploaded to GitHub and `opkg` is configured to use them. All
of the other software is available from OpenWrt's snapshots, but the ROM is not
configured to use them [by default].

If there is some missing package or kernel module, please open a GitHub issue or
send feedback to my e-mail or OpenWrt forum thread explaining exactly what's
missing. It will be added to the next release.

### Memory subsystem

The device has only 256/512 MB of RAM. That's plenty but sometimes it might get
a little short (i.e. when indexing a huge library with ReadyMedia). For this,
the memory subsystem has been tuned to support almost any NAS or adblocker load:

- The system will use the swap cache when possible. It's a pool of the 30.00% of
  the system memory (when used alone), compressed using `lzo-rle`, which is one
  of the fastest compressors available. The system will eventually evict pages
  to a real swapping device (which also includes `zram`) when it can't compress
  them, when they are too old or when the pool is getting depleted.
- When `zram` comes online with the `lzo-rle` compressor (the default unless you
  change it in LuCI, when usig `zswap` it will use `zstd` instead), it will
  adjust the `zswap` pool, so both pools (torgether) will use the user's
  requested space; and then the system will set this space for swapping. `zram`
  has a slower but yet more powerful compressor.
- If the backing file/device is setup correctly, pages that are hard to
  compress, or that are too old in the `zram` pool will be eventually evicted to
  the storage, freeing the memory and lowering the compressor overhead, in a
  process called "compaction".

#### What's the gain?
There are several use cases for this:
1. If the system is using only `zswap`, then great I/O operations will be
  avoided, making the system work faster at the cost of a portion of the memory.
  `zswap` will evict the never-used pages to the slow, real device over time,
  reducing the footprint by keeping only the actually needed in memory.
3. If the system is using only `zram`, then all of the I/O is avoided. The
  `zram` compressor is not as fast as `zswap`, but can guarantee good savings,
  because it can compress better as it's a block device and not a LRU cache.
4. If the system is using both, pages that the kernel needs constantly will land
  in `zswap` which is really fast and offers decent savings. Older and not so
  easy to compress pages will be evicted to `zram`, where they may be compressed
  better at the cost of more time required to do so. This way, users can benefit
  from the fast `zswap` and from the good `zram` at the same time.
  4.1. When using a real swap device, `zram` will be filled first and only when
      the system cannot write more pages to it, it will begin to use the real
      swap. The benefit: avoiding swapping at all costs. The bad side: older and
      never-used pages will remain in memory, they cannot be sent to the swap
      device.
   4.2. In order to alleviate problems in 4.1, `zram` can evict pages to a
       "backing storage" device, so when using the "triple layer" (zswap -> zram
       -> device), the system can use the memory more efficiently than the
       default configuration.

By using compressed memory, the kernel will delay the memory starvation. This is
because most of the memory loaded by programs is only used once, most of the
time. If the kernel cannot reproduce the memory, for example, anonymous memory,
it's forced to keep it, either in RAM or in swap.

## Notes for this release

This is a full custom configuration optimized for IPQ40xx devices. The purpose of
this build is to give the user a sensible selection of software for testing and
using OpenWrt without too much effort. It's also optimized for lower latency and
fixes for many annoyances.

This build contains some important changes compared to OpenWrt. It contains some
customizations that cannot be found in the official OpenWrt image or the OpenWrt
repositories, making both kind of incompatible. Specially because it contains
several kernel patches.

Please: perform a factory reset if you are replacing OpenWrt with this and 
viceversa or else your device will soft brick, and you'll see yourself doing a
recovery.

## Take into consideration

For saving space, install the OpenSSL version of the software if another SSL
version is available. This is because OpenSSL and `libopenssl` are already
installed (and compressed in the firmware image, therefore saving space).

LuCI has full OpenSSL support. However, for your convenience, you can access the
HTTP version of LuCI. This is because it's not convenient to install a random
self-signed certificate every single time. You can use the HTTP version, restore
your certificate and then disable the HTTP access.

> Be careful if you are using a public IPv4 or IPv6. Try to keep the access to
 your device as tidy as possible, for your security. It is totally safe to use
 HTTP in your LAN (if you trust your clients) but do not expose it to WAN, you
 will be leaking your `root` password that way.

The default IP address is now `192.168.xx.1` and IPv6 is `fd00:192:168:xx::1`,
the `xx` means that every supported device has a different subnet IP.
Hostname is `Civic`, 'Convexa-B', 'Convexa-S' or `Dallas`.

For LuCI Administration WebUI, go to
 - DNS: http://192.168.xx.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/unbound
 - IPv4: http://192.168.xx.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin
 - IPv6: http://[fd00:192:168:xx::1]/cgi-bin/luci/admin

```
Wireless password:
 - [Hostname] -> OpenWrt on [Hostname]
Login password:
 - admin -> admin
 - root -> root
```
> Note: [Hostname] refers to the device's default host name, you should replace
 that placeholder accordingly. For example, the SSID for Dallas will be
 `Dallas` and the password will be `OpenWrt on Dallas`.
